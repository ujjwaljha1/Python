Python dictionary comprehension is a very useful feature if you want to construct dictionaries in one line of code. We can construct a dictionary using a {key : value} mapping directly from an iterable object like, lists.

Syntax :
{key_expression: value_expression for item in iterable}

Condition in dictionary comprehension
We can customize the dictionary comprehension by adding conditions to each of the iterations.

Python3

# Using dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary of squared even numbers
numbers = {x: x**2 for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2 == 0}
print(numbers)
Output - {2: 4, 4: 16, 6: 36, 8: 64, 10: 100}

Creating a dictionary from Lists
You can also create dictionary from existing lists, making one of the list as keys and the other as values.

Python3

keys = ['a', 'b', 'c']
values = [1, 2, 3]
result = {k: v for k, v in zip(keys, values)}
print(result)
Output - {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

Nested dictionary comprehension
You can add dictionary comprehensions to dictionary comprehensions themselves to create nested dictionaries.

Python3

dictionary = {
    k1: {k2: k1 * k2 for k2 in range(2, 6)} for k1 in range(5, 7)
}
print(dictionary)
Output - {5: {2: 10, 3: 15, 4: 20, 5: 25}, 6: {2: 12, 3: 18, 4: 24, 5: 30}}

Challenge Galore
Problem Statement - Find Common Elements from the given multiple Lists.
Python3

def find_common_elements(lists):
    common_elements = {element: min(lst.count(element) for lst in lists) for element in set.intersection(*map(set, lists))}
    return common_elements

list1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]
list2 = [2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
list3 = [3, 4, 5, 5, 6]

result = find_common_elements([list1, list2, list3])

for element, frequency in result.items():
    print(f"Element: {element}, Frequency: {frequency}")
Output - Element: 3, Frequency: 1
Element: 4, Frequency: 1

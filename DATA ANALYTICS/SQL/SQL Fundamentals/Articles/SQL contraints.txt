Introduction
SQL Constraints are rules enforced on the data columns of a table. These constraints ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data within the database. Constraints can either be specified at the time of table creation (using the CREATE TABLE statement) or after the table has been created (using the ALTER TABLE statement). This article delves into the various types of SQL constraints and provides practical examples to understand their functionality.

PRIMARY KEY Constraint

The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table. A table can have only one primary key, and the primary key columns must contain unique values. It cannot contain NULL values.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Employees (

EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,

FirstName VARCHAR(50),

LastName VARCHAR(50)

);

FOREIGN KEY Constraint

A FOREIGN KEY is a field in a table that is a primary key in another table. The FOREIGN KEY constraint maintains referential integrity by ensuring that the relationship between the tables remains consistent.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Orders (

OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,

EmployeeID INT,

FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeID) REFERENCES Employees(EmployeeID)

);

UNIQUE Constraint

The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are unique. Unlike a primary key, a table can have multiple unique constraints.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Employees (

EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,

Email VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE

);

NOT NULL Constraint

The NOT NULL constraint ensures that a column does not accept NULL values, thereby ensuring that every row in the table has a value for that column.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Employees (

EmployeeID INT NOT NULL,

FirstName VARCHAR(50),

LastName VARCHAR(50)

);

CHECK Constraint

The CHECK constraint enforces that the values in a column satisfy a specific condition. You can use it to ensure data integrity according to your specific business rules.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Orders (

OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,

Quantity INT CHECK (Quantity > 0)

);

DEFAULT Constraint

The DEFAULT constraint sets a default value for a column. If no value is specified for that column, SQL will automatically insert the default value.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Employees (

EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,

Country VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'USA'

);

INDEX Constraint

While not a constraint in the traditional sense, an index can improve query performance. Indexes can be unique or non-unique.

Example:

CREATE INDEX idx_employee_id ON Employees (EmployeeID);

Composite Constraints

Constraints can also be composite, which means they can be applied to more than one column. For instance, you can have a composite primary key or a composite unique constraint.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Registrations (

StudentID INT,

CourseID INT,

PRIMARY KEY (StudentID, CourseID)

);

Summary

SQL constraints are essential for maintaining the quality and integrity of the data within your databases. From unique identifiers like PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE to referential rules with FOREIGN KEY and conditional logic via CHECK, these rules help to keep your database clean, consistent, and reliable. Understanding how and when to use these constraints is a cornerstone skill for effective database management.

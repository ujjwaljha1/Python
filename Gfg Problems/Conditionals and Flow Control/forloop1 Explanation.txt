Explanation:
Input:

The function utility() reads an integer n from the input.
Generating Multiples:

The range(1, 11) generates numbers from 1 to 10.
For each i in this range, i * n computes the multiplication of n and i.
Printing Results:

print(i * n, end=" ") prints each multiple followed by a space instead of a newline.
Handling Multiple Test Cases:

The main() function handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and calling the utility() function for each test case.
After each test case, a newline is printed to separate the results of different test cases.
This implementation ensures that the multiplication table is printed correctly in a single line with spaces separating the values.

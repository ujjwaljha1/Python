ASCII, which stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a standard used to represent characters in computers and other devices. Each character is assigned a unique numeric code within the ASCII range. In Python, you have built-in functions and methods that allow you to interact with these ASCII codes, making it easy to perform operations involving characters and their corresponding numeric representations.

Conversions with ASCII Code
1. Character to ASCII Code
You can use the 
ùëú
ùëü
ùëë
(
)
 function to get the ASCII code of a character.

Python3

char = 'A'
ascii_code = ord(char)
print(f"The ASCII code of '{char}' is {ascii_code}")
Output - The ASCII code of 'A' is 65

2. ASCII Code to Character
Conversely, the 
ùëê
‚Ñé
ùëü
(
)
 function converts an ASCII code to its corresponding character.

Python3

ascii_code = 97
character = chr(ascii_code)
print(f"The character with ASCII code {ascii_code} is '{character}'")
Output - The character with ASCII code 97 is 'a'

Working with Strings
1. Iterating Through Characters:
You can iterate through each character in a string and obtain its ASCII code.

Python3

text = "Hello"
for char in text:
	ascii_code = ord(char)
	print(f"The ASCII code of '{char}' is {ascii_code}")
Output - The ASCII code of 'H' is 72

The ASCII code of 'e' is 101

The ASCII code of 'l' is 108

The ASCII code of 'l' is 108

The ASCII code of 'o' is 111

2. Converting String to ASCII Codes:
You can convert an entire string into a list of ASCII codes.

Python3

text = "Python"
ascii_list = [ord(char) for char in text]
print(f"ASCII codes of characters in '{text}': {ascii_list}")
Output - ASCII codes of characters in 'Python': [80, 121, 116, 104, 111, 110]

Challenge Galore
Problem Statement - Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
Python3

def encrypt(message, shift):
    encrypted_text = ''.join([chr(ord(char) + shift) for char in message])
    return encrypted_text

def decrypt(encrypted_message, shift):
    decrypted_text = ''.join([chr(ord(char) - shift) for char in encrypted_message])
    return decrypted_text
  
encrypted_message= encrypt("Hey Geek! What's your progress?", 5)
print("Encrypted Message :", encrypted_message)
decrypted_message = decrypt(encrypted_message, 5)
print("Decrypted Message :", decrypted_message)
Output -Encrypted Message : Mj~%Ljjp&%\mfy,x%~tzw%uwtlwjxxD

Decrypted Message : Hey Geek! What's your progress?
